# Projects

## Attention‑Aware System for Mixed and Augmented Reality Controls in Armoured Vehicles - DSTL Open Call for Innovation Cycle 2 – Project Ref: ACC2006330

**Duration:** Mar 2020 - Feb 2021

Project done under [Cambridge Intelligent Systems UK Ltd](http://cambridgeintelligentsystems.co.uk/)

### Objectives
The project focused on developing a VR simulation environment that allowed testing operators' reactions to various configurable threats under different levels of aiding visualisation mechanisms. The mechanisms made use of the operator's gaze direction to adapt themselves and/or deactivate, as well as input taken from menus interacted using the UltraLeap sensor. 

### Project highlights and deliverables
* Held regular meetings with DSTL members to distil requirements for the final system. 
* Delivered a VR simulation environment developed in Unity Engine (C#) using the UltraLeep sensor and Oculus Rift headset capable of deploying pre-configurable scenarios in two environments (an open snowy landscape and an urban city).
* Demonstrated through interim and final live demos the capabilities of the environment to stakeholders at the UK MoD armed forces and DSTL.


### Capabilities of the simulation environment included
* 3D models for human and vehicle threats that would suit the simulation environments. 
* NPCs behaviours, including pathfinding, spawning, threat escalation and their corresponding animations/sounds. 
* Parameterisable capabilities in the system to change the number of threats, intervals, visualisations and the path followed through the simulation. 
* Standard NATO threat nomenclature symbol tagging on 3D models. 
* 3 dynamic attention-aware visualisations: 1) Tracking of attended and non-attended areas in 360-world map and minimap, 2) Out-of-view pointers to threats with extra animations if not attended to, and 3) Animated motions to NATO threat nomenclature symbols when left unattended.

## Mixed Reality Controls for Armoured Vehicles - DSTL Open Call for Innovation Cycle 3 – Project Ref: ACC2000981
**Duration:** Dec 2018 - Oct 2019

Project done under [Cambridge Intelligent Systems UK Ltd](http://cambridgeintelligentsystems.co.uk/)

### Objectives
The project's objective was to compile the requirements and deliver a simulation environment that would allow trialling the deployment of a new VR UI, based on the General-Vehicle-Architecture (GVA) architecture with UltraLeap capabilities, to be used inside armoured vehicles. VR was used to simulate an AR deployment, as such, the simulation environment replicated the views from inside and outside the vehicle as well as allowed operators to see their arms during operation.

### Project highlights and deliverables

* Held regular meetings with DSTL/MoD members to distil requirements for the final system. 
* Delivered a VR simulation environment developed in Unity Engine (C#) using the UltraLeep sensor and Oculus Rift headset capable of deploying pre-configurable scenarios in two environments (an open snowy landscape and an urban city).
* Demonstrated through interim and final live demos the capabilities of the environment to stakeholders at the UK MoD armed forces and DSTL.
* The final deliverable consisted of the VR environment (Oculus Rift) built in Unity (C#) UltraLeep input capabilities. The environment allowed interaction with various GVA interactable menus that allowed switching between in- and out-of-vehicle views with passthrough capabilities for arms/hands. 

### Capabilities of the simulation environment included
* Multi-virtual fully-interactable GVA UI deployment within the environment. 
* Fully-interactable GVA menus of various types following domain specifications (shape, colours, behaviours)
* In- and out-of-vehicle spherical 360 simulated cameras that could be rotated/directly manipulated through touching gestures (scrolling) using the UltraLeap. 
* Multi-axis cameras for outside and inside views from the vehicle. 
* Head-up UI to incorporate key moving platform controls and add new virtual ones: compass, minimap of current location and threats, and 360 augmented spherical view with threat markers/pointers in the virtual environment.

## Distributed multi-display system and middleware for close proximity operator gaze and attention tracking - Project Ref: ACC101965 

**Duration:** May 2017 - Dec 2017

Project done under [CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY TECHNICAL SERVICES LIMITED](https://www.enterprise.cam.ac.uk/for-the-university/be-a-consultant/)

### Objectives
The project's objective was to deliver an attention-aware distributed middleware for multi-display multitasking applications that used eye-trackers to feed attention events/information to web applications through an API. Use-case was potential deployment in air traffic control. Capabilities included showing the location of unseen data points, visualising the relative age of data, highlighting unattended points with timers and inter-display notifications based on attention focus. 

### Project highlights and deliverables
* Attended briefings and held meetings with DSTL/UK MoD and National Air Traffic Services (NATs) members at secured sites to gather requirements.
* Delivered six packages and one live demo to stakeholders, as well as reports. 
* The final deliverable consisted of the middleware developed in C/C++ that was capable of receiving eye-tracking data from each individually connected machine and aggregating it into global attentional events that could be delivered to subscribed applications and used to trigger events through hooks. 

### Capabilities of the simulation environment included
*  Middleware capable of interacting with Tobii eye-tracking drivers. 
* Determination of attention focus through data fusion. 
* Configurable discretisation grid for matching data changes to eye fixation events. 
* API with hooks for delivering messages/events to applications. 
* Overlay library built in Javascript (d3.js) capable of drawing on top of web applications to highlight data points, and show relative data age and relative position of data changes across displays based on the operator's current focus of attention.

# PhD Research
## Thesis Title: Design, Implementation And Evaluation Of An Attention Management System 

**University of Cambridge, UK**

* Designed a middleware system architecture with multiple components capable of interoperating with various
sensors across multiple networked computers to detect operator's attentional states within applications, match
it to application's data changes and deliver instructions to applications based on evaluation of live operator and
task performance.
* Used a completely agile development philosophy as requirements were discovered through direct experimentation and iteration. All component and test development was Git source controlled.
* Implemented a sensor networking component built in C++ directly interacting with both structured lighting
sensors and eye‑tracker drivers in C/C++.
* Implemented a live monitoring component developed in Python with TCP and WebSockets to directly interact
with sensor information and Web applications built in TypeScript.

* Implemented a the live performance visualiser tool in TypeScript/React with d3.js to showcase live operator
performance and retrospectively.
* Implemented a simulator in Python that could re‑run captured operator actions to model alternative operational outcomes under different visualisation policies. This could plug into the performance visualiser.
* Evaluated system through experiments involving live testing with whole system integration and simulation
using collected participant task performance data. Results published in peer‑reviewed papers.

## Additional Research / Software Development / Maintenance Tasks

**University of Cambridge, UK**

* Participated in the research group's Scrum group for developing tools/libraries that were used across the entire research group. This included live graphing data through d3.js, Unity interfaces for prototyping, networking
libraries for logging results, sensor polling and ML model building.
* Maintained documentation to shared resources and libraries for the research group that I owned.
* Deployed and maintained the VMs and Docker containers used in the research group's local servers for running
experiments and number crunching.
* Developed and maintained Python scripts using psutil to monitor the usage of the research group's local
servers to ensure up-time and catch any user misuse/abuse.
* Used AWS services to test and build ML models from sensor data collected for various research projects. This
allowed maximising resource utilisation so only specific parameters in the search grid would get scheduled for
building models based on previous results.
* Developed an application that exposed through an API the head pose of an operator in a 5m x 5m room fitted
with 8 Microsoft Kinect 2.0 through a purposely built ML classifier model. Work published in HCCS 2018.
* Developed Android apps to collect data on various Fittz Law tasks that were used by the research group in some
of their publications.
